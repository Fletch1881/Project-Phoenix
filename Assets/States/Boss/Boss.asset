  storyText: "As you enter its lair, the boss swings its axe at you. You manage to
    dodge the first attack by dropping to your knees. You can feel the force behind
    the swing and realize one false move could mean the end. Quickly, you get on your
    feet again. Stepping back you see a towering figure standing close by. The figure
    is standing in the way of a brazier and you are able to make the outline of a
    minotaur. It rears back as if about to charge...\r\n\t- Try to pierce the boss
    (Up) \n\t- Dodge left (Left) \r\n\t- Dodge right (Right)\r\n\t- Stand your ground
    with your sword (Down) "
